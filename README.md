Grab 'em
======

My aim is to make a Javascript powered album art scrapper. It will be using iTunes' search API and some JS mumbo-jumbo.

Currently, it is very basic, but I aim to do add more functionality at some point. If you want to try it out, [download](https://github.com/rowellheria/grab-em/archive/master.zip) a copy of this repo and open `index.html`.
